# Youtube_API
YouTube API for fetching YouTube videos of any given channel

This HTML code represents a web page that displays a YouTube video gallery. It allows users to view and play videos from a specific YouTube channel. Here's a short description (README) of what the code does:

This web page utilizes the Bootstrap framework and jQuery library to create a responsive YouTube video gallery. It includes a header and a container div that holds the gallery. The gallery is dynamically populated with video thumbnails, titles, view counts, and durations retrieved from the specified YouTube channel using the YouTube Data API.

The JavaScript code in the <script> tags handles the functionality of the video gallery. It loads the YouTube API and fetches the video data using the YouTube Data API key and channel ID. The fetched video data is then displayed in the gallery, and users can click on a thumbnail to play the corresponding video in a modal window.

Additionally, the code makes use of Moment.js library to parse and format the duration of the videos in a user-friendly manner.

The web page also includes a subscribe card that prompts users to subscribe to the YouTube channel. It uses the YouTube Subscribe button code to display the subscribe button.

Overall, this code provides a simple and interactive way to showcase and play YouTube videos from a specific channel on a web page.
